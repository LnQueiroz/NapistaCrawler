## Crawler

This code is a web crawler designed to access "https://www.napista.com.br" website and retrieve all car listings in main page from Francisco Beltr√£o city. The crawler extracts specific information from these cars. Gemfile contains all required gems. Use bundler to install dependencies.

### Output

Here's an example of the output you can expect from running the crawler:

```json
[
  {
    "modelo": " S10 Blazer Dlx 2.5 Diesel Turbo",
    "marca": "Chevrolet",
    "valor": "45000.00",
    "ano": "2000",
    "src_path": "https://napista.com.br/static/photos/7a17dc20-4eb4-4070-9ed8-85bb8ed80a03_2f69292a-c81f-4a27-9455-bc0796ff1e81",
    "local_path": "images/Chevrolet-2000-20240428_134743"
  },
  {
    "modelo": " X1 Sdrive 20i X-line 2.0 Tb Active Flex",
    "marca": "Bmw",
    "valor": "149900.00",
    "ano": "2018",
    "src_path": "https://napista.com.br/static/photos/6130ae76-70f7-4e85-807f-48bb9644dd12_238b1c65-6036-4a45-9765-9662db417e20",
    "local_path": "images/Bmw-2018-20240428_134744"
  },
  ...
]
```

The term "local_path" indicates the file path where downloaded images of cars are stored. Upon running the crawler, a folder will be automatically generated to store these images.

The "src_path" denotes the website image source.

The JSON containing the list of cars will be generated and saved as "cars_info.json".
